## Dusk terminology

#### Confidential Security Contract Standard (XSC)

A standardized framework for confidential smart contracts, which any company or organization can customize according to business-specific requirements (e.g., complying with data privacy and financial regulations).

#### Kadcast

## Definitions

#### Account

In an account-based blockchain, a combination of a private key and a public key where a user's funds are stored as a balance.

#### Account-Based Transaction Model

A protocol that represents assets as balances within personal accounts, similar to bank accounts.

#### Application Program Interface (API)

Software code that enables communication between different systems via request-response messages. It enables tasks like requesting user balances, listening to on-chain events and more.

#### Asset Token

A category of tokens that represent a “real world” asset or product — such as a commodity (e.g., gold) or currency (e.g., US dollar) — as opposed to utility tokens, which provide network-specific functions.

#### Balance

The assets owned by an account in an account-based transaction model, available for exchange or spending.

#### Bandwidth

The maximum amount of data that can be transmitted across a path in a fixed period of time.

#### BLS Digital Signature

A digital signature that uses elliptic curves to encrypt the public key and private key of the parties involved in order to permit people to sign transactions on the blockchain without revealing any data.

#### Block

Files in which data of the network is permanently recorded. A block permanently stores records of transactions which, once written, cannot be altered or removed. Every time a block is completed, a new block is formed in the blockchain.

#### Block Explorer

#### Block Generator

#### Consensus

A process where the majority of validators agree on the current state of the blockchain.

#### Cryptographic Hash Function

A special class of hash function that has certain properties in order to make it secure and ideal for cryptographic purposes, including the following: (i) it is deterministic, meaning it always produces the same result; (ii) it is fast, meaning it returns the hash of an input very quickly; (iii) it is pre-image resistant, meaning it is virtually impossible to determine the original input data from its hash value; and (iv) even a small change in the input data would result in a massive change to the hash value.
