This documentation provides an insight into everything related to development on Dusk. It covers the creation of smart contracts, but also how to integrate Dusk and its applications into your own projects.

## Developing on Dusk

There are two different stacks to develop on Dusk. The first one is building on-chain the second one is building off-chain applications that integrate with Dusk.
