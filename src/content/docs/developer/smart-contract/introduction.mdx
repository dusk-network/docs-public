Smart Contracts are a key feature of Dusk, playing a fundamental role at the protocol level. Specifically, both transferring the native currency and 
staking functionalities are implemented as <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk/tree/master/contracts" target="_blank">genesis contracts</a>.

On top of that, the Dusk core team continues to develop and integrate smart contracts themselves into the Dusk ecosystem. 
The Dusk smart contract platform is a tailor made basis for specific dApps of any developer but specifically for using, the development of financial market infrastructure products such as Zedger.

This **Smart Contracts** section guides you through the different aspects of smart contract development on Dusk and how you can start developing your own contracts on Dusk.

## What is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is a self-executing digital agreement whose terms and conditions are directly written into lines of code. Even if the concept of smart contracts has been <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html" target="_blank">introduced in 1994</a>, it became more popular after the creation of general purpose blockchains. The reason is that storing smart contracts on a blockchain ensures transparency, security, and immutability.

## Smart contracts on Dusk

Dusk offers robust support for smart contracts, as developers can leverage the features offered 
by <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk" target="_blank">Rusk</a>, specifically **execution-core** and **rusk-abi**.
The rusk-abi serves as an entrypoint to be able to interact with the lower level underlying VM, which is called **Piecrust**.

Theoretically, developers can use any programming language that compiles to WebAssembly (**WASM**), but we strongly recommend developers to use Rust due to its extensive support in our ecosystem.

In order to deploy a smart contract, developers only need to compile their contracts to WASM together with exposing the functions to the host. 

### Comparison

Here a simplified comparison between Dusk and other smart contracts platforms:

|          Feature          |      EVM      |   CosmWasm    |    Solana     |          Dusk          |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :--------------------: |
| Main Programming Language |   Solidity    |     Rust      |     Rust      |          Rust          |
|    Transaction Models     | Account-based | Account-based | Account-based | UTXO and account-based |
|     Compiling Target      | EVM bytecode  |     WASM      |      BPF      |          WASM          |
|            VM             |      EVM      |      No       |   Sealevel    |        Piecrust        |
