description: An overview of the wallet ecosystem in Dusk.

Wallets are a crucial part of any network, they're the gateway for users to interact with it. Our stack consists of a number of libraries to interact with the chain:

- [wallet-core](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk/tree/master/wallet-core)
    A WebAssembly/Rust library that allows you to write transactions for transfer, stake and do basic wallet actions.
- [rusk-wallet](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk/tree/master/rusk-wallet/)
    A wallet library and CLI tool written in Rust to interface with our network.

There's a specific guide on how to use the API of `wallet-core`. `rusk-wallet` is both an application meant to be used as a standalone wallet, and a library used for enriching `wallet-core` in a CLI context.
